For example, `/:a-:b`.\n\n### Patches\n\nFor users of 0.1, upgrade to `0.1.10`. All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`. \n\nVersion 0.1.10 adds backtracking protection when a custom regular expression is not provided, so it's still possible to manually create a ReDoS vulnerability if you are providing custom regular expressions.\n\nVersion 7.0.0 can enable `strict: true` and get an error when the regular expression might be bad.\n\nVersion 8.0.0 removes all features that can cause a ReDoS and stops exposing the regular expression directly.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAll versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.\n\nIf paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.\n\n### Details\n\nUsing `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\\/([^\\/]+?)-([^\\/]+?)\\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.\n\nBecause JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.\n\n### References\n\n* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n* [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j"},"1099529":{"findings":[{"version":"4.19.2","paths":["express","@hmcts/info-provider>express"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<4.20.0","module_name":"express","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-qw6h-vgh9-j6wx","cves":["CVE-2024-43796"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=4.20.0","cvss":{"score":5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"},"updated":"2024-09-10T19:41:07.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 4.20.0 or later","cwe":["CWE-79"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1099529,"references":"- https://github.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-qw6h-vgh9-j6wx\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43796\n- https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/54271f69b511fea198471e6ff3400ab805d6b553\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qw6h-vgh9-j6wx","created":"2024-09-10T19:41:04.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"express vulnerable to XSS via response.redirect()","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"### Impact\n\nIn express <4.20.0, passing untrusted user input - even after sanitizing it - to `response.redirect()` may execute untrusted code\n\n### Patches\n\nthis issue is patched in express 4.20.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nusers are encouraged to upgrade to the patched version of express, but otherwise can workaround this issue by making sure any untrusted inputs are safe, ideally by validating them against an explicit allowlist\n\n### Details\n\nsuccessful exploitation of this vector requires the following:\n\n1.
